# Credit_risk_modelling
we have addressed the problem of classifying highly unbalanced data using supervised machine learning algorithms. Unbalanced data is ubiquitous in nature, itâ€™s dealt with in a wide range of fields including but not limited to that of business, bioinformatics, engineering and banking sector. We have focussed here on Credit Risk, which is defined as risk of default on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments. In the first resort, the risk is that of the lender and includes lost principal and interest, disruption to cash flows, and increased collection costs. Usually in a Credit Risk problem, loan default is a rare phenomenon and that is why we have such unbalanced data.
